#  :woman_technologist: Secret Contract Tutorials

This is a fork of a repository of tutorials designed to teach you how to make Secret Contacts on Secret Network. 
I've customed this Repo modifying some code functionalities and adding dosctrings.

### Reminder Smart Contract
In this Repo we develop a Secret Smart Contract from scratch using the CosmWasm module as a plug-in to Cosmos SDK. The use case of this smart contract is very simple: initialize, query, and handle a message to the Secret Network blockchain (testnet), hence the name `reminder` sicne we are storing and quering a reminder message to a blockchain via a smart contract. We'll add Viewing Keys to read the reminder without paying any gas fees. Withouhg viewing keys, each reading of the reminder message would make the user incur into a gas fee. Secret Viewing Keys allow you to avoid such trivial cost.
